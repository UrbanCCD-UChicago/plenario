# MacPorts system-wide global variants configuration file.

# Any variants listed here are applied to all port builds. As on the
# command line, variants may be either enabled (+) or disabled (-), and
# unsupported variants are simply ignored.
#
# Each line must be a space- or tab-delimited list of zero or more
# variants.
#
# Example:
#   -x11 +no_x11 +quartz
#   +gcc48
#   +universal
