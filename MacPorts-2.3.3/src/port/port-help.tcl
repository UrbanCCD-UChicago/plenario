set will be used.  The other options which do not correspond to fields are:
   --depends   An abbreviation for all depends_* fields
   --index     Do not read the Portfile, instead rely solely on the index
               information. Note this option will prevent the information
               reported from reflecting the effects of any variants specified.
   --line      Report on each port on a single line, with fields separated
               by spaces.  Handy for automatically processing the output of
               info called on a large number of ports.
   --pretty    Format the output in a convenient, human-readable fashion. Note
               that this option is the default when no options are specified to

set porthelp(rev-upgrade) {
Scan for broken binaries in the installed ports and rebuild them as needed. Can
be run with -y to only report broken ports, but not automatically rebuild them.

You normally wouldn't have to run rev-upgrade manually; it is run automatically
after each install and upgrade by default. Rev-upgrade doesn't honor package
names, e.g.
	upgrade outdated
will not run rev-upgrade only on outdated, because ports not in outdated might
have been broken by upgrade outdated. Rev-upgrade will always run on all your
active ports.

See man 1 port, section rev-upgrade, and man 5 macports.conf, directives
starting with revupgrade_ for configuration and more information.
}

set porthelp(rpm) {

set porthelp(search) {

--glob    treat the given search string as a glob (default)
--line    print each result on a single line
--regex   treat the given search string as a regular expression
--<field> match against <field>, default is '--name --description'
}

set porthelp(select) {
Select between multiple versions of a versioned port

This allows you to choose which version, among several installed versions
of a port, is to be considered primary.  What this means is which version
becomes the one most would consider the default, e.g. the one run without
specifying any version.

One example is the set of python ports, where there are (among others)
python25, python26, and python31.  The select action lets you set which
of these becomes the version run when you simply use 'python'.

<arguments> must include the group upon which to be acted, and may include
a version if --set is used. <arguments> can be empty for --summary.

--list     List available versions for the group
--set      Select the given version for the group
--show     Show which version is currently selected for the group (default
           if none given)
--summary  Display a summary of all available select groups and choices as
           well as the currently selected ports.
}

}

set porthelp(uninstall) {
Uninstall the given ports

--follow-dependents     Recursively uninstall all ports that depend on the
                        specified port before uninstalling the port itself.
--follow-dependencies   Also recursively uninstall all ports that the
                        specified port depended on. This will not uninstall
                        dependencies that are marked as requested or that
                        have other dependents.
--no-exec               Do not execute any stored pre- or post-uninstall
                        procedures.

set porthelp(unload) $porthelp(load)

set porthelp(upgrade) {
Upgrades the given ports to the latest version. Respects global options
-n, -R, and -u (see the port man page).  Note that in selecting variants
to use in the upgraded build of the port, the order of precedence is variants
specified on the command line, then variants active in the latest installed
version of the port, then the variants.conf file.

--force             Ignore circumstances that would normally cause ports to be
                    skipped (e.g. not outdated).
--enforce-variants  If the installed variants do not match those requested,
                    upgrade even if the port is not outdated.
--no-replace        Do not replace one port with another according to the
                    replaced_by field
