Description: 
        Metar is a python package for interpreting METAR and SPECI weather
        reports.
        
        METAR is an international format for reporting weather observations.
        The standard specification for the METAR and SPECI codes is given
        in the WMO Manual on Codes, vol I.1, Part A (WMO-306 I.i.A).  US
        conventions for METAR/SPECI reports are described in chapter 12 of
        the Federal Meteorological Handbook No.1. (FMH-1 1995), issued by
        NOAA.  See http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/wdc/metar/
        
        This module extracts the data recorded in the main-body groups of
        reports that follow the WMO spec or the US conventions, except for
        the runway state and trend groups, which are parsed but ignored.
        The most useful remark groups defined in the US spec are parsed,
        as well, such as the cumulative precipitation, min/max temperature,
        peak wind and sea-level pressure groups.  No other regional conventions
        are formally supported, but a large number of variant formats found
        in international reports are accepted.
Platform: Python 2.7 and later.
