contextlib2 is a backport of the `standard library's contextlib
module <https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/contextlib.html>`_ to
earlier Python versions.

It also serves as a real world proving ground for possible future
enhancements to the standard library version.

Development
-----------

contextlib2 has no runtime dependencies, but requires ``unittest2`` for testing
on Python 2.x.

Local testing is just a matter of running ``python test_contextlib2.py``.

You can test against multiple versions of Python with
`tox <https://tox.testrun.org/>`_::

    pip install tox
    tox

Versions currently tested in both tox and Travis CI are:

* CPython 2.6
* CPython 2.7
* CPython 3.4
* CPython 3.5
* CPython 3.6 (CPython development branch)
* PyPy

tox also has a PyPy3 configuration, but it is not configured in Travis
due to a
`known incompatibility <https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/issues/1903>`_.

To install several of the relevant runtimes on Fedora 23::

    sudo dnf install python python3 pypy pypy3
    sudo dnf copr enable -y mstuchli/Python3.5
    sudo dnf install python35-python3
